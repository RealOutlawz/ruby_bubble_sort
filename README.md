# ruby_bubble_sort

This project contains a Ruby implementation of the bubble sort algorithm. I developed this project to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental sorting techniques and Ruby programming. The code includes several test cases to ensure its functionality and correctness. Feel free to explore the implementation and accompanying test scenarios â€“ it's a simple yet illustrative example of a common algorithm.
